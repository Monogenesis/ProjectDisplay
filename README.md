# Project Gallery

Project to display and showcase my own projects. The readme files from projects on Github are uploaded to the page.

## Motivation

I always found it a pity that I never had a short overview of my interesting projects at hand when I wanted to present them to someone. So I came up with the idea to put the readme files from my Github projects that were of interest on a separate web page.

## Demo

Take a look at my project gallery here: https://monogenesis.github.io/ProjectGallery/
